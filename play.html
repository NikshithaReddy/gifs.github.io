     <dt><h3>Creates happiness, reduces stress</h3></dt>
        <dd>-  Laughing together and having fun can keep the seniors happy and healthy.</dd>
     <dt><h3>Spending time together</h3></dt>
        <dd>- Often the family members have different schedules which push us in different directions.
             But playing games (maybe a card game) even for a short while with your elderly loved ones is a perfect way to spend time together</dd>
     <dt> <h3>Memory formation and cognitive skills</h3></dt>
        <dd>- Board games or any indoor games help us to practice essential cognitive skills and 
            enhance the parts of the brain responsible for complex thought and memory formation.</dd>
     <dt><h3>Lowers blood pressures</h3></dt>
        <dd>- Laughter helps in producing endorphins (a chemical that gives the feeling of happiness) and that naturally help muscles
         to relax and blood to circulate which will evidently lower blood pressure.</dd>
